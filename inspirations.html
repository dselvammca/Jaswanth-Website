  <p>People whose dedication and mindset inspire me to learn, practice, and stay humble.</p>
</section>

  <h3>Ravindra Jadeja (Cricket)</h3>
  <p>Electric on the field—an all‑rounder who proves consistency is a superpower.
     His work rate, fitness, and calm under pressure motivate me during cricket practice.
     Jadeja shows that fielding can change matches, not just batting and bowling.
     I try to bring his energy and focus to school sports.
     Small improvements daily → big results.</p></div></section>
<section class="card role">
  <img src="assets/images/L1.jpeg" alt="Lee Chong Wei"><div>
  <h3>Lee Chong Wei (Badminton)</h3>
  <p>Legendary footwork, discipline, and never‑give‑up attitude.
     He teaches me to move smart, not just fast, and to respect opponents.
     His training stories remind me to practice basics again and again.
     I watch his highlights before my sessions.
     Badminton is my favorite because of players like him.</p></div></section>
<section class="card role">
  <img src="assets/images/r2.jpeg" alt="Dr A. P. J. Abdul Kalam"><div>
  <h3>Dr A. P. J. Abdul Kalam (Science & Leadership)</h3>
  <p>India’s “People’s President” and a scientist who loved teaching.
     He believed great dreams lead to great achievements.
     His life shows how curiosity and kindness can live together.
     I read his quotes when a project feels hard.
     Science is for serving people—his biggest lesson.</p></div></section>
<section class="card role">
  <img src="assets/images/r3.jpeg" alt="Sundar Pichai"><div>
  <h3>Sundar Pichai (Technology Leadership)</h3>
  <p>From student to leading teams that build tools for billions.
     He communicates simply and listens carefully.
     That reminds me to explain my projects clearly at school.
     Stay humble, keep learning, help others—that’s real leadership.
     Tech + empathy can change lives.</p></div></section>
<section class="card role">
  <img src="assets/images/r4.jpeg" alt="Viswanathan Anand"><div>
  <h3>Viswanathan Anand (Chess)</h3>
  <p>Lightning‑fast thinking and sportsmanship.
     Chess teaches patience and planning—useful for robotics debugging.
     Anand shows how to learn from losses and return stronger.
     I practice tactics to train my brain like a muscle.
     Strategy first, then speed.</p></div></section>
<section class="card role">
  <img src="assets/images/r5.jpeg" alt="M. S. Dhoni"><div>
  <h3>M. S. Dhoni (Calm Leadership)</h3>
  <p>Cool under pressure and a mentor to young players.
     He trusts the team and makes brave decisions.
     I try to stay calm when a circuit fails and fix it step by step.
     Leadership is action, not a title.
     Finish the game—don’t give up.</p></div></section>
<section class="card role">
  <img src="assets/images/r6.jpeg" alt="Mary Kom"><div>
  <h3>Mary Kom (Grit)</h3>
  <p>Champion, mother, and fighter who never stops improving.
     She balances family and training with discipline.
     Her story tells me to use challenges as fuel.
     Respect, courage, and hard work win outside the ring too.
     Keep punching towards your goals.</p></div></section>
